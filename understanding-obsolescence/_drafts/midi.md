### MIDI ###

Quite a lot of MIDI
http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_type%3A%22audio/midi%22
1996 example, Flip Player ok but QuickTime and VLC not.
Same for most recent example.
VLC can be modified to support it https://wiki.videolan.org/Midi
Server-side would be a lot easier.
