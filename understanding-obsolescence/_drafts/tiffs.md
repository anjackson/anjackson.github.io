### XIF (.xif) ###

Note that AADDA has *1* distinct XIF: http://www.webarchive.org.uk/interject/inspect/http://web.archive.org/web/20030807223708/http://www.wburrows.org.uk:80/IMechE%20OU.xif
AADDA has no DICOM, LDWA has one: http://192.168.1.204:8990/solr/ldwa/select?q=content_type_ext%3A%22dicm%22&wt=json&indent=true and amusingly it is the example from the paper!
