### Pre-1995 ###
Difficult to identify...

These are only identified by Tika, but may be down to file extension.

DROID spots only this V6 one?

Hm, first two may be text, this looks more likely:

http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_type_ext%3A%22.doc%22&f[1]=content_ffb%3A%22fe370023%22
Based in part on example from 
http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/DOC
http://msxnet.org/word2rtf/formats/ffh-dosword5#16.1

Based on that, e.g. 0x31be0000
http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_ffb%3A%2231be0000%22

Similarly for v 6.0: 6031* not many, just one, but appears to be malformed HTML?
"all full-saved Word documents begin with 0x6031, 0x000, 0xAB00"
http://www.webarchive.org.uk/aadda-discovery/formats?f[0]=content_ffb%3A6031*

A range of FFB popular combos that remains unclassified. eg. %FE7%00# and related that may be early Word documents.
File says they are MSOffice, but they upset Tika rather badly.
Droid says: application/msword; version=5.0
