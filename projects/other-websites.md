<h4>nutshells</h4>

In online database of links for <a href="http://www.riscos.com/">RISC OS</a> users, written in Perl and using a custom flat-file database backend.  Quite old now, and perhaps a little basic, but still useful.

<h4>eChums.net</h4>

A new project, built mostly by myself but based on ideas generated by <a href="http://www.rab.org.uk">Richard Blythe</a>, <a href="http://www.grahamdavies.org">Graham Davies</a> and I.  Currently under development.

<h4>ILDG</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031003075231/http://www.lqcd.org/ildg/tiki-index.php"><img src="/extras/images/logos/ildg-logo-sml.png" alt="ildg logo" align="right"></a>
Website for the international lattice datagrid community.
Essentially <a href="http://tikiwiki.sourceforge.net/">Tiki</a> - installed, tweaked and administrated by me.
</p>

<h4>HPCx</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030213042402/http://www.hpcx.ac.uk/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/hpcx-logo-sml.png" alt="hpcx logo" align="right"></a>
I created the Server-Side Include system that controls the overall look and feel of these pages, designed and implemented the CVS web-authoring mamagement procedure, and provided techinical help during the design and development of this site.  I was also one of a small
team of software engineers who created the HPCx Administration Server - a complex system of Java Servlets, Java Server Pages and Perl Scripts.  For example, have a look at the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030205015208/http://www.hpcx.ac.uk/services/status/">service status page</a>. As well as designing the images and layout of this page,  I also wrote the backend which (for various reasons) passes the relevant data back along a code-invocation chain that runs SSI - Perl - Java Servlet - ssh login to service machine - Perl.
</p>

<h4>EPCC</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030213073448/http://epcc.ed.ac.uk/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/epcc-logo-sml.png" alt="epcc logo" align="right"></a>
I acted as a technical consultant during the procurement procedure for the EPCC website, and assisted their own web designer in the more technical aspects of the PHP-based system as the design was implemented and evolved.
