As the OAIS standard, now ISO XXXX, is up for review, the digital preservation community is being invited to get involved in that revision process.

Fuzzyness of meaning of the boundary, implications for definition of SIP/AIP/DIP. 

Verbed-Noun problem of SIP/AIP/DIP, different meanings, too vague, implications of standards definitions. Possible sensible general definition (next package SHOULD be the info in previous package, plus provenace metadata including the chain of care. Where transformation has been performed, this should be made clear.) We could recommend self-contained packages that retain meaning in different contexts.

Emphasis of linear mode of access rather that cycles of enhancement. Layering. Lightbox. Not sure where this comes from.

OAIS is a model for an archive, but not of digital preservation itself. 

In terms of defining what an archive *actually* does, it's just a 'reference model', and necessarily abstract.

But I want to emphasis that digital preservation is also much more that OAIS, and the assumptions that are built into it.  OAIS describes one way for digital information to persist, but it does not described the persistent of digital information in general.

It doesn't deal with what digital preservation actually is, and indeed it should not. But it attempts to establish standards for describing digital preservation systems, but being based in one set of practices, much of it leans towards particular approaches. Even if the language has been abstracted enough to allow it to be bent around other ways of working,
