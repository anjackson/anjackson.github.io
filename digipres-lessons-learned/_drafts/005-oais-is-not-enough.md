OAIS is a model for an archive, but not of digital preservation itself. 

In terms of defining what an archive *actually* does, it's just a 'reference model', and necessarily abstract.

But I want to emphasis that digital preservation is also much more that OAIS, and the assumptions that are built into it.  OAIS describes one way for digital information to persist, but it does not described the persistent of digital information in general.
