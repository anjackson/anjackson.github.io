### What are we preserving?

But it is common to talk about 'preserving digital objects', such as [Preserving digital Objects with Restricted Resources][9], [Preserving Complex Digital Objects][10] or [Preserving the Authenticity of Contingent Digital Objects][11] (although oddly, the [DPC perservation handbook does not define it][12]).  In this context, the term 'digital object' is *mostly* used to refer to bitstream (or bitstreams), at least among those of us working in the shadow of OAIS. But it's also use to refer to other layers of representation, right up to 'the thing I interact with' (e.g. see [A Theory Of Digital Objects][5]). 

But surely the latter is closer to what we really mean to preserve? Who cares what the encoding is, as long as the text remains unchanged? If we place the emphasis of preservation upon the bitstream, don't we risk losing sight of the fact that it is the *experience* of access that we are trying to preserve?

This confusion peaks when it comes to defining the 'significant properties' of these objects, and in the worst cases, lead to property models built on a mish-mash of bitstream properties and properties observed during use.
