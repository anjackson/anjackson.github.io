What do we mean by 'digital object'? 

Well, the *official* answer is clear enough:

> Digital Object: An object composed of a set of bit sequences. 
> <small>[Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) ][1]</small>

Other treatments have attempted to draw more attention to the layers of interpretation around bitstreams -- to the software. For example, [Kenneth Thibodeau's tripartite model][3] teases the digital object into physical, logical and conceptual layers.  The team behind [BitCurator][7] tease the notion of a digital object into even more layers:

> ![BitCurator Levels of Representation]({{site.url}}/blog/images/ll/bitcurator-levels-of-representation.jpg)  
> "The various levels of representation in what we consider to be digital objects @BitCurator @openpreserve"
> <small>[@digitalfay][6]</small>

Thinking along similar lines to Thibodeau, Matthew Kirschenbaum argues as follows:

> "Here I want to go a step further and suggest that the preservation of digital objects is logically inseparable from the act of their creation — the lag between creation and preservation collapses completely, since a digital object may only ever be said to be preserved if it is accessible, and each individual access creates the object anew. One can, in a very literal sense, never access the "same" electronic file twice, since each and every access constitutes a distinct instance of the file that will be addressed and stored in a unique location in computer memory."
> <small>[Matthew Kirschenbaum](https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum), [The .txtual Condition][4]</small>

All the approaches outlined here share a common assumption -- that the bitstream is fundamental. But by the end of the first sentence from Kirshenbaum, the digital object is *also* the thing created anew inside the memory of the machine. At once, both the bitstream *and* something approaching Thibodeau's 'logical object'.

Kirshenbaum's perpertual re-creation is much closer to the National Archives of Australia's [performance model][8], which avoids the term 'digital object' altogether. Rather, it describes the digital record as a something performed by a process, built from a source.

primacy such as:

> Regardless of whether one is interacting with digital objects as distinct entities or interacting with representations that aggregate various sources, the process is highly mediated by hardware and software. 
> <small>[Digital Curation as Communication Mediation][2]</small>

In other words, the bitstream is the fundamental element, the atom of both preservation and use. Moreover, we interact with the digital object via the appropriate software and hardware.

Behind the 'performance', the bytes in flight.

Any model that seeks to describe digital resources as they are, rather than as we might wish them to be, must understand the distinction. Otherwise, we are left with a framework that cannot describe the most basic acts of digital preservation: 'Save as..' and 'Load...'. Only the NAA performance model comes close.
