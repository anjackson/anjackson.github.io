## Method ##



## Results ##




## Conclusion ###

Once your bitstream is loaded, the thing you are interacting with is not the bitstream. What was once a neat, contiguous bitstream has now been spread around and interleaved with the software that loaded it.

Same when created.

This is the story of every digital resource. Every single one is born as *bytes in flight*, entangled with the software that defines it.

Code always comes first, and the first act of digital preservation is always 'Save as...'
