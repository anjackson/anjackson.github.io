Let's start with an experiment...

## Conclusion ###

Once your bitstream is loaded, the thing you are interacting with is not the bitstream. What was once a neat, contiguous bitstream has now been spread around and interleaved with the software that loaded it.

Same when created.

This is the story of every digital resource. Every single one is born as *bytes in flight*, entangled with the software that defines it.

Code always comes first, and the first act of digital preservation is always 'Save as...'

[^1]: Go on, admit it, you've always wanted to try this and see what happens. Well, now you get to do it. For Science.
[^2]: The two images were highly similar, with a [PSNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio) of just over 56dB and with a distribution of differences that looks like [this]({{site.url}}/digipres-lessons-learned/images/save-as/difference.png). It is not clear if the variation is due to small differences in JPEG compression parameters, or if all the parameters are the same but the implementations have small difference in execution (e.g. rounding errors).
