- [It starts with Save as...](../010-save-as)
- ['Load' is not the opposite of 'save'](../020-load-versus-save)
- [Don't say Digital Object](../030-dont-say-digital-object)
- [We Preserve Processes](../040-we-preserve-processes)
- 'Significant Properties' Won't Save Us
    - Gap between 'Significant Properties' and significant properties.
    - Things that work don't actually describe the performance or the process.
    - What are the significant characteristics of the Mona Lisa?
- [Formats Define Significant Properties](../060-formats-define-significant-properties)
    - http://www.dpconline.org/events/previous-events/288-significant-properties
- Identification Links Bitstreams to Software
    - Formats are behaviours, not properties.
- Validation is unnecessary
    - Not always possible, Halting Problem etc.
    - Note fast-fail versus linting modes.
- Emulation is a type of migration
    - The Migration Line
- The biggest preservation risk: unsustainable investment
- Obsolescence is obsolete
    - Vendors drive it.
    - Open source avoids it, largely.
    - Compare with hardware obsolescence.
- We can learn from Adobe Lightroom
- The AIP Is Never Finished
- OAIS Is Not Enough (models a preserving organisation not preservation itself)
    - OAIS Is Still Not Enough (pre-ingest/inner ring - models a repository or an organisation?)
- Provenance does not guarantee trust
- Digital Preservation Is Not A Science
    - Like the use of the work Tool, the use of the work Theory is confusing.
    - 'Theory', but this is more like literature.
    - Also crucial importance of value judgements
    - Scientific approach is appropriate in many cases
    - Emergent behaviour is complex
    - But it might look more like medical science
