PBP is a web test tool based on John J. Lee's mechanize. It exposes the browser functionality at the level of a shell-like interpreter so that testers can quickly write tests in a simple language designed specifically for that purpose. Anyone familiar with a command line should be able to write test scripts for even the most complex web applications with PBP.
