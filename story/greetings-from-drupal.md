Perhaps this is a better approach?  Although due to network lag between NZ and Europe its difficult to tell if things really are faster, this PHP MySQL solution should outrun the Java-based <a href="http://snipsnap.org/">SnipSnap</a> [Wiki|wiki]/[Weblog|blog] I put up <a href="http://anjackson.net/snipsnap/">here</a>.

Just investigation options really.
