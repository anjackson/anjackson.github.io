### The State Of The Hard-Sphere Solid

A journal-club-style-type seminar outlining these two papers:

_Stacking entropy of hard-sphere solids_

> Siun-Chuon Mau & David A. Huse, April 1999: Physical Review E, Vol. __59__, No. 4, pp. 4396-4401.

_Can stacking faults in hard-sphere crystals anneal out spontaneously?_

> Sander Pronk & Daan Frenkel, March 1999: Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. __110__, No. 9, pp. 4589-4592.

With a bit of the stuff I'm doing as well.
