!!!Continuum Physics II Examination Assignment
!!Finite difference simulation of the baking process
Andrew N. Jackson - 5th May 1996
!Introduction
The brief for this assignment can be outlined as follows. I am to put myself in the position of having been employed by a firm of commercial bakers to investigate the factors underlying the successful baking of cakes. For a simplified cake (ie having made certain assumptions about it), I will consider the factors which influence the baking time and final condition of the cake, and using this information go on to sketch out a plan for a simulation model. From this model I can then devise an appropriate flow diagram for the actual code structure.

An application of basic finite-difference techniques. (3rd Year)
