<img src="/themes/anjackson.net/sw/Extractor.gif" border="0" align="left" />A nearly un-small application to allow Acorn sprites to be converted toscreen-memory format.In other words, it converts images into a simple format so that they can be easily plotted by either your own or the supplied ARM assembly language routines.Basically, people who are creating games or demos may find it useful.Quite flexible conversion and output formats.I'll try to add a list of features to this page at some point. The output format is not compatable with GameSuite yet, and I may not get round to making it so.
