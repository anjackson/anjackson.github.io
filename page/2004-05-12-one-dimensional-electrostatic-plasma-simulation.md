!!!One Dimensional Electrostatic Plasma Simulation
!!An application of the particle-in-cell technique
This experiment concerned the use of two closely
related particle-in-cell simulation techniques, and their
comparison with eachother and with the theoretical
results for the behaviour of standing waves in the
plasma charge distribution. The two techniques
compared were the cloud-in-cell (C-in-C) and nearest
grid point (NGP) particle distributions. It was found
that, while the C-in-C was invariably the slower
method, it was generally the more accurate for the
extra time it required. Landau damping of the
standing waves was observed and the damping
behaviour was compared with that predicted by
theory, with mixed results.
