## History
Aero was launched as 'the new chocolate' by Rowntree in October
1935, at a cost of 2d.(old pennies).  Initially it was available only in
the North of England, distribution expanding throughout the UK
the following year.  By 1936 Aero had reached New York.  It was one
of the first products promoted by Rowntree primarily on the
strength of the brand, rather than the company name.

Aero's success owes much to its unique bubbly texture.  From the
first television advertising campaigns screened during the 1950s, the
secret bubbly formula has proved a major success in providing the
inspiration behind the 'Lovely Bubbly Aero' campaign.

Aero has undergone a series of developments in packaging, bar size
and flavour, with the most significant innovations being the 1982
and 1996 relaunches.  In 1982, the first countline Aero bar was
introduced.  This new 'chunky' bar resulted in sales of Aero almost
doubling in the following few years.  In 1996, Aero was reinvented as
a light, indulgent bar marketed directly at the female chocolate
consumer with the successful slogan 'Float away with an Aero'.  The
traditional block Aero was redesigned to improve the breakage
quality of the individual chunks.  The wrappers of both the
traditional and countline bars were redesigned in 1996, featuring a
new Aero logo.

In August 1999, the Aero pack was redesigned again and a new TV
ad featuring the Aero Hot GospeRers on air from September.  The
title of the gospel song, "Have you ever felt the bubbles melt?" is
also the new strap line for Aero.  It is reflected in improved pack
graphics which feature an enlarged 'O' with a stream of chocolate
bubbles issuing from it.

## Production
Aero bars, eggs and Christmas pies are all produced at the Nestle'
Rowntree factory in York.  There are ten members and one shift
leader in each production team and three shifts per day.  Each shift
produces approximately 11% -12 tonnes of chocolate.  Aero
production has improved in efficiency since more tonnage is now
produced with ten people in a team than previously with 20 people
in the team.

Output of Peppermint Aero tends to be greater than Milk Aero.  The
pepperinint chocolate is harder and breaks less frequently than the
softer, milk variety.

As well as seasonal products such as Aero Nflnt Eggs, approximately
two to three times a year limited edition 3OOg and 6OOg Milk Aero
and Peppermint Aero bars are produced.

The factory at York also produces Aero for the overseas market.
This year has seen an increase in exports to Canada and Australia.
Interestingly, the chocolate used to produce Aero for Australia is
different from the UK market chocolate.  To change from UK
production to Australian production takes approximately four to
rive hours.  It is acceptable to allow Australian chocolate to flow into
UK chocolate, but not vice versa.

The Aero moulds automatically regulate production.  If a solid bar is
produced by mistake, it is rejected and replaced.  It takes 17 minutes
for the chocolate to reach the correct temperature for it to be
deposited into the Aero moulds.  The mould settings can be changed
according to the different dosage of chocolate required for each
particular size of bar.

The liquid chocolate then passes through a shaker to ensure that all
the moulds are filled to the correct level. Aero production is not
wasteful.  If too much chocolate has been poured into the mould, it is
recycled.  The machine turns the moulds upside down to shake off
any excess chocolate.  Similar recycling processes occur throughout
production.

The next stage of production is cooling.  The chocolate shell must be
stiffened before the centre is added.  The cooling process takes
approximately 20 minutes before the required temperature has been
reached.  The process is delicate since the chocolate shells must not
be completely solidified.  Also, they need to be warmed again slightly
before the secret formula, bubbly centre can be added.  The way in
which the unique Aero bubbles are added is a top secret, patented
process closely guarded by Nestle' Rowntree.

Once this has been completed, the chocolate bars are once again
passed through the shakers.  This is to ensure the centre has been
poured in evenly.  The bar shakers are, however, less severe than the
shell shakers.

The bars are then subjected to the licking roller.  The roller removes
the very top layer of the bar, leaving a quarter inch gap.  This is
necessary to ensure the back casing of the bar can be attached.  The
bars must enter a second cooler, again for twenty minutes.  The back
of the bar can now be added.  The third and final cooling process
ensures the back casing becomes hard.  The chocolate is now
tempered and will not turn white.

Vften the bars leave the final cooler, they are twisted to ensure they
are loose.  A number of hammers are added to the twister to lift the
bars from the moulds.  Milk Aero bars which are soft must only be
hammered once.  But Peppermint Aero can take two or even three
blows of the hammer due to its extra strength!  The bars are now
released and the moulds return to the very beginning of the
production process.

## Wrapping and packing

Approximately three hundred and thirty Aero bars are wrapped per
minute.  The wrappers are then gummed and coded.  The bars are
then loaded into cartons.  Aero destined for the UK market is packed
into cartons containing two dozen bars.  Aero cartons, which must
travel to Australia, contain three dozen.  Changing cartons between
the UK and Australia takes about forty-five minutes!  The machine
itself must be changed when switching to produce Australian bars
or Giant Aero.  Whilst twenty-seven moulds can be processed per
minute for traditional bars, Australian and Giant bars can only be
produced in quantities of sixteen to seventeen moulds per minute.

Once the bars have been wrapped and stamped, they must pass
through a metal detector.  This is to ensure that no foreign bodies
have, entered the Aero products at any stage of the production
process.  The coding machine must be checked every fifteen minutes.
If the labels have not been printed correctly, they cannot be sold!
