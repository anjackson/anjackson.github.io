### Development of software for the computation of the properties of electrostatic electro-optical devices via both the direct ray tracing and paraxial approximation techniques.
## MPhys Final Year Project Dissertation by Andrew Jackson

# Abstract
This project concerns the development of software designed
to simulate electro-optical devices; the potential being calculated via the
finite element method, and the optical behaviour determined by paraxial
and direct ray racing. The direct ray tracing technique, previously only
used for finite difference grids, has been developed by using new
interpolation techniques (to cope with the variability in mesh point
distribution inherent in the finite element technique), and also by testing
various different integration algorithms under these conditions. The
new software has been found to be act as a useful tool for visualisation
of lens behaviour, and has been found to give reasonable quantitative
results for the predicted lens properties in comparison to the paraxial
approximation and to the results published in the literature for the
standardised two-tube electron lens.
