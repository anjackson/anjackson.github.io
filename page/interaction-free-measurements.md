### Interaction-Free Measurements
## Learning To See In The Dark
Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo observation can be made without at least
one photon striking the observed object.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢
Dennis Gabor (1962)

This is NOT true.

Quantum optics allows us to determine the
presence of an object with essentially
no photons having touched it.
