My 'I am...' page was created after I recieved this somewhat snotty e-mail...

 Subject: question
 DO you have any info on Andrew Jackson because you web page does not?

So now, it does. Of course, he could have meant the civil war general and ex-American president Andrew Jackson. But that's not me, cos he's dead and I'm not.
