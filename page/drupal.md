###  Drupal & Me
Drupal is a powerful PHP-based website engine that I have used to help seperate the styling of my web pages from the content.  The 'look' is described by a Drupal theme I created, and is stored in a set of files on the server.  The page content is stored in a more presentation-neutral format in the back-end MySQL database.
