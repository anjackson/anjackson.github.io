!!!The Nuclear Reactor
An application of Monte Carlo simulation methods
This experiment concerned the accurate simulation,
via Monte Carlo methods, of an infinite and finite
spherical nuclear reactor of homogeneous nature.
The main aim being to analyse how the proportions of
constituent atoms in the reactor affected it's
performace and so how to balance these proportions
in order to create an efficent system. Having done
this, the effect of finite size of the reactor performance
could be determined. It was discovered that there is a
well defined set of conditions for maximum efficiency
and that the size of the reactor has a significant effect
on the reactor performance at macroscopic levels.
