### Simulation: A Bluffer's Guide.

A brief journey into the rÃƒâ„¢le, form and limitations of computer simulation in condensed matter physics.

(distinctly non-exhaustive, rather subjective and not a lot of quantum mechanics either.)

An attempt to place my work into context.

Also, an excuse for using clip-art gratuitously.
