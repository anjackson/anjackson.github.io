### Summary
Is it possible to circumvent the patenting of ideas, particularly in the form of Software Patents, by creating a repository where Open Source folks can publicize their ideas.  We are only concerned about ideas that are considered obvious by those in the field, so we do not lose anything when people decide to keep ideas to themselves because ideas that good cannot be that obvious.  Once the idea has been openly published, that should mean that patents on the idea should not be granted, and if granted would be trivially invalidated.

## Requirements?
* Author of the idea to be traceable (in the real world).
* Solid, trustworthy and untwiddlable time stamps to prove _prior art_.
