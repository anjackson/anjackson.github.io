!!!Particle Simulation II Course Assignment
!!Andrew N Jackson 14th Feburary 1997
!Introduction
The aims of this assignment are two-fold. Firstly, to write a two-dimensional collisionless particle-incell code which simulates the behaviour of N identical masses interacting via the gravitational force, and secondly, to use this program to simulate some aspect of the evolution of galaxies. The problem of galactic evolution can be simulated in this way via the following model.

A P3M finite-difference simulation. (4th Year)
