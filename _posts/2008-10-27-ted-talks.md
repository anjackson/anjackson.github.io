I've been impressed by the growing volume of free talks, books and other high-quality informationalistic edupodloads.  I thought I'd list a few of my favourites here - read on for the link-love...
<!--break-->
The top sources for talks I've been looking at lately are on [The Nobel Prize site](http://nobelprize.org/), [The Ted Talks site](http://www.ted.com/) and [The Reddit Lectures list](http://www.reddit.com/r/lectures/) (although this latter list is a bit more variable in quality).

I particularly like the TED talks, see for example this [top ten list](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/06/26/top-10-ted-talks.html), this talk by the artist largely known as The PC Guy (
[John Hodgman: A brief digression on matters of lost time](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/john_hodgman_s_brief_digression.html)), and and almost-Derren-Brown [Keith Barry: Brain magic](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/keith_barry_does_brain_magic.html).

I also liked [An inside tour of the world's biggest supercollider](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/brian_cox_on_cern_s_supercollider.html), and finding out about the possibility of purchasing a [Cuddly Higgs Boson](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/09/13/higgs-boson-plush-to.html) to match.

Share & Enjoy.
