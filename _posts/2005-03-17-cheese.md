Crikey.  How out of touch am I?  On a similar note to the Hitchikers thing, it turns out that [Wallace & Gromit](http://www.wandg.com/) will be big-screen movie stars this October.  The [trailer/featurette](http://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/wallace_and_gromit/featurette) is worth watching, if only to hear talk of northern towns and cheese and crackers, all in Yorkshire accents, clashing brightly against the cheesy deep-throat Hollywood voiceover.
