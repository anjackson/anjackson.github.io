Well, finally tracked down the optimization bug.  A weird Intel chip + gcc issue that can be described as an 'extended precision problem'.    Its pretty dull, but likely to hit many folks doing my kind of work, so I'm putting a summary on a <a href="/book/view/528">seperate page</a>.  On a lighter note <a href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/QRIO/story/">this is scarily human</a>, and <a href="http://hinterlands.cc/index.php?showtopic=30">this is pretty cool</a>.
