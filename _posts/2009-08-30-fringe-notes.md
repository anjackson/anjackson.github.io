Edinburgh. Used to live there, you know. Nice place. Been a while. Until last weekend. Visited the [Blythes](http://www.theblythes.org/). 

Outline: drive, drive, chat eat chat drink chat, sleep, cat, wake, cat, freshen, un-fast, bus, [fringe](http://www.edfringe.com/)...

Firstly, [Flanders and Swann: A Brand GNew AfterGNoon](http://www.edfringe.com/ticketing/detail.php?id=15081), featuring my old friend from Derbyshire, [Tim FitzHigham](http://www.fitzhigham.co.uk/). Tim has previous on the Fringe, and he's usually been running two shows a day, plus a few extras. This year, Tim's wasn't able to run his solo show, but the Flanders and Swann show was great fun. It featured a new selection of songs and a new script to tie them together, which is probably just as well as following last year's show we bought the CD and listened to it a bit too much. 

After the gig, we got to hang about with Tim for a couple of beers.  It was great to catch up, and to hear that his writing appears to be going well.  Last year, I bought a copy of his book 'In The Bath', which tells the story of Tim rowing across the channel in a bathtub. It has now been released as a paperback under the name "All At Sea: One man. One bathtub. One very bad idea."

Later on, we went to see [Adam Hills: Inflatable](http://www.edfringe.com/ticketing/detail.php?id=14758). The show successfully wove some more serious thoughts in with the comedy, much of which arose from the interaction between Adam and the live-action signer for the deaf. A solid four-star rating.

Finally, at a ridiculous hour, we went to see [Daniel Kitson at the Stand](http://www.edfringe.com/ticketing/detail.php?id=14351). Daniel
 Kitson is simply very, very funny.  No other act I've seen can render me helpless with laughter - giggling like a child with ribs and cheeks aching and tears in my eyes. His work is always very personal, very honest, and I think this contributes much to the power of the storytelling. You've not Fringed until you've Kitson'd.

...and then, more sleeping, more waking, more [eating](http://www.fruitmarket.co.uk/cafe/), more chatting, more shopping, and more driving, and a good time was had by all.
