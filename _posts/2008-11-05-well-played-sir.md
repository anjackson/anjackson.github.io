Well, we all got the American president that they deserve.  It's good to [hear about all the goodwill and hope in the air](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/11/05/the-us-presidential.html).  

Obama is known as an eloquent orator, but as far as I can tell his victory speech has not been aired in full on the news here in the UK.  However, it is on the  BBC website and is worth a watch: 
[Obama's victory speech in full](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/us_elections_2008/7710079.stm).

Earlier in the campaign, during the investigations into Obama's connnection to a controversial Reverend, I was also impressed by his speech about race: [A More Perfect Union](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zrp-v2tHaDo).

p.s. I wonder how many people are teaching their spell-checking software the word 'Obama' today?
