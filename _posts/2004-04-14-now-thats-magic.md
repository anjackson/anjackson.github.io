Crikey.  I've just booked a [Magic Bus](http://www.magicbus.co.nz/) [Transalpine Experience](http://www.magicbus.co.nz/index.cfm/ProductDetail/ProductID/8), so it looks like next week's trip is all sorted.  Sure, I've not organized any accommodation, but surely they'll not be booked up yet!?  Even in autumn the tourists are in full force - I suspect the only reason summer/Christmas are so busy is that all the kiwi's are on holiday as well.  I'm sure it will work out okay - things usually do.  I'll also look into adding a [Magic Milford Discovery](http://www.magicbus.co.nz/main/ProductDetail/index.cfm/ProductID/43), a [HeliHike](http://www.helicopter.co.nz/helihike.asp), a [Catlin's Coaster](http://www.magicbus.co.nz/main/ProductDetail/index.cfm/ProductID/75) and maybe even a [Cook Connection](http://www.magicbus.co.nz/main/ProductDetail/index.cfm/ProductID/42).
