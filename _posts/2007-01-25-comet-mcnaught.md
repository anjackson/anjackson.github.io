The southern hemisphere is a great place to view [Comet McNaught](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_McNaught) as it moves away from the Sun. It can be seen clearly from Wellington, as long as you get high enough to see over the hills.  Here are our [slightly blurry (no tripod) photos](http://anjackson.net/ibgallery/151) taken from Mt Victoria.
