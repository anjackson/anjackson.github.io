Well, I had a pleasant enough time on Ko Chang.  The odd beer, a quiet little full-moon party, meeting the occasional local and the more frequent Brit.  But only 9 days remain, and I still have much to see...

Currently in a place called Trat.  It's not the kind of place that gets a good write up in guidebooks, but I rather like it.  It feels more like a normal Thai town, with less scamming and general touristyness than the other places I've been.  Only here for the one night though, as I'm going into Cambodia and through to Phenom Penh tomorrow.  It will be a long day, but it should be interesting.

There's a few stories I haven't managed to get down here on my weblog, and a some more ''firsts'' as well.  Whenever you next see me, feel free to ask about my first time as a marriage proposee, or perhaps my first time in trouble with the police (not as 'exciting' as it could have been, thankfully!).
