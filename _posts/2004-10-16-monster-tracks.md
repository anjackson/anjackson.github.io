[image:1434 right margin=5]'''Monster''' track has to be ''Wow'' from ''Final Straw'' by ''[http://www.snowpatrol.net/ Snow Patrol]''.  It really rather hits the mark.  In fact the [http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001BH15K/202-6537669-9498213 whole album] is pretty darned good.  Go get it.  ''Spitting Games'' is also a favourite, if only for the lines:
:''My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes''
:''As blue as oceans and as pure as skies''
And ''Grazed Knees'' is a bit of a stand-out track too.

Was also surprised to find out that these UK folks hadn't heard of [http://www.steriogram.com/ Steriogram] yet.  I hadn't realised that they were an NZ band, and the near-saturation play of the award winning knitted video for the fine single ''Walkie Talkie Man'' in NZ and the fact that that same track was being used in the UK iPod advertisements had lulled me into a false sense of, erm, understanding what what going on.  Or something.  Go [http://www.steriogram.com/ check 'em out].

Not long now.  And still not packed.  Don't. Panic.
