Well, thanks for the feedback.  After a number of people explained I was being insane, and probably guaranteeing that I'd herniate something, I decided not to bring the bike home.  At first the kind folks here offered to sell it for me via that finest of NZ institutions, [trademe.co.nz](http://www.trademe.co.nz/)...
<!--break-->
Then it turned out that my boss wanted to buy a bike anyway, and offered me a good price too.  So, given the fact that I'd have to have bought a much larger bag for everything else, and could quite easily been hit for a fair chunk of import duty, the amount I'm losing on selling the bike and buying a new one in Britain is pretty insignificant.

So now I only have _everything else_ to sort out.  Yay.
