In 1989, while working at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch/), [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) invented [the Web](http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/history/inventedweb.html) so that scientists all across the world could share photos of their children and pets.  We are proud to be able to continue this tradition.  Read on to find out about the contents of our fish tank...

The old timers in the tank are Ford, the [Golden Gourami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Gourami):

Along with Trinny, the [Moonlight Gourami](http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/speciesSummary.php?ID=4729&genusname=Trichogaster&speciesname=microlepis):

Until recently, we had two of each species (named Arthur and Suzanna).  Sadly, they both died for no apparent reason.  So, yesterday, we popped out to [Dobbies](http://www.dobbies.com/) and brought in some [Bolivian Rams](http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=15902) as replacements.  Meet Chris:

And Gwynneth:

Gwynneth is rather shy, probably because Chris keeps bossing her around.  But generally, the fish seem to be getting on together well.

It's not clear if the Golden Gourami is a [Three Spot Gourami ](http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=4675), or a [Dwarf Gourami](http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/anabantids2/p/dwarfgourami.htm).  Wikipedia has a bit more about [Gouramies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourami), and About.com has these pages about the [Moonlights](http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/anabantids2/p/moongourami.htm) and the [Bolivian/Butterfly Rams](http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/southamerican/p/bolivianram.htm).  There's also the remarkable [fishbase.org](http://www.fishbase.org/).

p.s. Driving on my own felt really weird at first.  Getting used to it slowly.
