In 1989, while working at [http://www.cern.ch/ CERN], [http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ Tim Berners-Lee] invented [http://www.boutell.com/newfaq/history/inventedweb.html the Web] so that scientists all across the world could share photos of their children and pets.  We are proud to be able to continue this tradition.  Read on to find out about the contents of our fish tank...

Until recently, we had two of each species (named Arthur and Suzanna).  Sadly, they both died for no apparent reason.  So, yesterday, we popped out to [http://www.dobbies.com/ Dobbies] and brought in some [http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=15902 Bolivian Rams] as replacements.  Meet Chris:

Gwynneth is rather shy, probably because Chris keeps bossing her around.  But generally, the fish seem to be getting on together well.

It's not clear if the Golden Gourami is a [http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=4675 Three Spot Gourami ], or a [http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/anabantids2/p/dwarfgourami.htm Dwarf Gourami].  Wikipedia has a bit more about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourami Gouramies], and About.com has these pages about the [http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/anabantids2/p/moongourami.htm Moonlights] and the [http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/southamerican/p/bolivianram.htm Bolivian/Butterfly Rams].  There's also the remarkable [http://www.fishbase.org/ fishbase.org].
