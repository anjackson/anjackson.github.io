[image:1484 right hspace=5]Well, I thought it was about time I added some new photos to the site.  It's not like I havne been taking gazillions of them recently or anything.  Of course, the problem is finding the time to sort out which ones are the good ones and get them ready for uploading.  The full set of new pics can be found in the [http://anjackson.net/image/tid/122 November 2004 gallery].  The one off to the right here shows a southernly view from Mt Victoria, and shows my latest rash purchase, a [http://www.giant-bicycle.com/au/030.000.000/030.000.000.asp?dealerid=&dealercountry=&lYear=2005&bikesection=8802&range=75&model=9851 Giant Rincon] mountain bike...

There's about 6 decent bikable areas with 30mins of the town centre, and I intend to explore them whenever the weather allows.  Mount Victoria is particularly groovy as it is ridiculously close to town (behind Oriental Bay, where I lived last time I was here), and has some great tracks.  Managed to bit off a bit more than I could chew on the very first day I got the bike.  Nearly got thrown off coming down a particularly steep, slidy and tree-rooty bit.  Of course, ''nearly'' losing it is the fun part.

[image:1474 right hspace=5] Also added a few more images from the last trip, including this one, which get promoted straight to the [http://anjackson.net/image/tid/28 highlights gallery] as it is my favourite fern picture by far.  The other new ones can be found in the [http://anjackson.net/image/tid/39 January 2004 gallery], and in the [http://anjackson.net/image/tid/65 Abel Tasman gallery].
