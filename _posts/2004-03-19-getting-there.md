Well, this [Drupal] thing looks like it might just do the trick.  Currently trying to move my preferred web page style over to it - looking good so far but some tweaking required yet.

Now, the long awaited image gallery still requires plenty of work on top - largely because I need to review all my photos and pick the decent ones for webification.

This may all take some time...

p.s. Check out [Drupal]'s RSS/RDF-feed aggregators, e.g. <a href="/aggregator/bundle/riscos">this riscos one</a>.
