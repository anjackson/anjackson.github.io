Work at EPCC is over and I've made it home, stopping off along the way for a family get together at [Centre Parcs in Sherwood Forest](http://www.centerparcs.co.uk/b2b/sf_location.jsp).  This has become something of a new tradition for my family despite the nasty flashbacks I get to a primary school play involving me and a pair of rather verdant stockings.  Robin Hood has a lot to answer for...

So, having been throughly beaten up by an array of small cousins, I'm now in a fit state to start planning my next escape.  I'm currently busy trying to remember everything I need to remember before I can go, but all the big stuff has been sorted out so hopefully it will all be fine.  I have a work visa, a job, a place to live, and a most welcome tax rebate to help me along the way.  The latter will be particularly handy for the stopover in L.A. to see Catherine and Graham, which may or may not include a trip to Las Vegas.

Still feeling sorry to be leaving Edinburgh again, but looking forward to being in New Zealand.  I'm even keen to get into the work!  I still have absolutely no solid plans for what to do after this trip, but hopefully something will occur before too long. We shall see.
