Well, a lot has happened since I last updated the site.  I've been home a few times, had two weddings to go to and, sadly, a funeral to attend. I've also been entirely unemployed, but I've been busy enough settling in with Eilidh in our flat in Edinburgh and trying to get some of the NZ work done at home...

<!--break-->

The main news is that I've got a short-term contract back at EPCC, so I'll be working there for the next few months.  Not 100% sure what I'll be doing after that, but I have a couple of irons in a couple of fires.  The currently-favoured plan is to head back to academia for one post doc to see if I can hack it.  I don't think I'm ever going to be an outstanding researcher, but it might be possible for me to be reasonably useful and to enjoy it.

Anyway, I'll sign off for now.  I have a few entries I've been meaning to write, so there should be much more action on the site from now on.
