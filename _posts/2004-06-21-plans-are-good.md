Well, feeling a little better today, and generally had a more successful Bangkok experience.  Booked a train to Chang Mai and managed to wander round Chinatown and go to a few temples without getting much hassle.  Maybe it's the ethnic shirt I bought at the market!

Highlights include the 3m Budda statue made of actual real shiny golden gold, and the simply huge reclining Budda statue.  Ended up taking a landscape photo vertically to try and get the whole thing in one picture.  Even managed to successfully use non-tourist transport!  Okay, so it was just one bus, but it means a lot to me!

Basically, I'm glad to have plans, and to be moving on.  Bangkok has been a bit of a mixed experience, but I guess that's supposed to be part of the 'charm' of travelling. ;)
