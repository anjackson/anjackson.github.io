One of the minor pleasures of New Zealand was the [Flat White](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white).  It's essentially a cappuccino, but with a finer, creamer [foam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoam) and a stronger mix than you get in Britain. I've missed them, but I may have found an alternative source...

The unlikely caffeinated beverage dealer turns out to be Starbucks, of all the baristarers. They have a secret product, called the ['Short' Cappuccino](http://www.slate.com/id/2133754/), which is smaller than the smallest size on the actual menu, the 'Tall'. The BBC has a article about it, [explaining why Starbucks wouldn't advertise it's best product](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5274352.stm).  Most of the coverage I've seen is about the U.S., but [apparently you can buy one in the UK too](http://nick.recoil.org/2007/7/11/starbucks-short-cappuccino).  I don't go to Starbucks much these days, but whenever I do, I'll see if they can deliver a flat white.
