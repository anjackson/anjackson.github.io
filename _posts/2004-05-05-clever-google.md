Just to balance up after yesterday's entry, I thought I'd tell you about a rather nifty new feature of [Google|http://www.google.com/].  The search engine now has the ability to act as a [calculator|http://www.google.co.nz/help/calculator.html], so you can do stuff like this: [1+1 is...|http://www.google.co.nz/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=1%2B1&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=].

The really clever part is that the Google calculator understands units and knows a fair number of physical constants, so you can ask it stuff like this:

`2.883kg*c*(1.21 kph + 88 mph)/(2.0*pi*1 A.U.*6.3m/(s^2))` in `lb`

And you get the [right answer|http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=2.883kg*c*%281.21+kph+%2B+88+mph%29%2F%282.0*pi*1+A.U.*6.3m%2Fs%5E2%29+in+lb&amp;btnG=Search ].  Pretty cool, in the extremely geeky sense of the word cool.
