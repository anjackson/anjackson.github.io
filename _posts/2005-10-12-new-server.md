Just to let you know that the website and my anjackson.net email may have been behaving strangely over the last few days.  I've been moving between servers, from a virtual server (where I was sharing a computer with others) to my own server.  It's just a cheap one, but it should be noticably quicker and has an awful lot more disc space.

The upshot of all this is that I may have lost any email sent to me over the last few days.  As far as I can tell, I've not lost any, but please resend if there is no reply.
