[Eddie Izzard](http://twitter.com/eddieizzard) is currently [about two-thirds](http://twitter.com/eddieizzard/status/3634574366) of the way through his attempt to run up and down the entire UK. He's running a marathon a day, almost every day, for about eight weeks. He's doing it for Sport Relief, so why not [sponsor him for performing this feat](http://www.comicrelief.com/donate/eddie).
