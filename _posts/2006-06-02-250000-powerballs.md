[image:1628 align=right width=175] You've probably seen the recent 
[http://www.bravia-advert.com advert for Sony Bravia TVs] - it looks really cool (if you've not seen it, here's a link to a [http://www.bravia-advert.com/commercial/braviaextcommhigh.html long high-resolution version]).

The reason I bring it up is that when I saw it, I assumed it was all done with computer graphics - and I've since realised that quite a few other folks thought the same thing.  It glows in such an unworldly fashion, I assumed CG was the only way it could have been made.

There are a few pictures from the shoot on [http://www.flickr.com flickr], including this one showing them [http://www.flickr.com/photos/sepiatone/32300543/in/set-720725/ tipping the balls down the street], and a couple showing them [http://www.flickr.com/photos/sepiatone/72569069/in/set-720725/ hiding behind] thier [http://www.flickr.com/photos/saramorishige/29489513/in/set-658997/ protective barriers] (cardboard boxes) while filming.

The nice music is by [http://www.jose-gonzalez.com/ JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez], who is touring Europe with [http://www.zero7.co.uk/ zero7] this year.  Sadly, the only tour date near here is at T In The Park, which we decided not to get tickets for this year.  However, if you live near Manchester, London or Dublin, you might be able to catch them.  The new zero7 album (The Garden) is pretty good too.
