<p>
Just a quick blog to say thank you all for the lovely cards, phone calls, emails and texts Eilidh & I have received about our engagement.  Several people expressed a lack of surprise (much to our... surprise) on hearing the news.  We take this to be a good sign.  Either that, or we're very, <i>very</i> predictable.

<h3>OTHER BREAKING NEWS!!!</h3>
<p>
Driving lessons continue.  Some would perhaps suggest that buying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Clio">Renault Clio</a> prior to passing our driving tests was a little rash.  And to them we say: Pah!
</p>

<p>
Dancing lessons commenced several weeks ago (at <a href="http://www.dancebase.co.uk/">DanceBase</a>).  Our Beginners Ballroom experience means that we can now Waltz, Cha-Cha-Cha, Quickstep & Jive with the <strike>best of them</strike> rest of the class.
</p>

<p>
We've also been experimenting a little with the <a href="http://www.wagamama.com/">Wagamama</a> cookbook.  Fantastic results so far, but we need to find a soba noodle dealer.
</p>

<p>
Take care,<br/>
A&E
