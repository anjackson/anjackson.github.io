I can now verify that asking for a "Short Cappuccino" in Starbucks does indeed work, at least here in Leeds.  My order was accepted without comment.  It cost Â£1.85, and was indeed a sensible size and strength.  The foam, however, was run o' the mill chunky froth, so my search for a flat white must continue.
