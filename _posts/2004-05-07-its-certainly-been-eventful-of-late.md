Well, crikey.  Things were pottering along quite nicely and then all sorts of ups and downs appear from nowhere.  I went out to meet the other Andrew Jackson for coffee yesterday (which was good), after which we walked over to a cafe called [Lido](http://www.wellingtonnz.com/RestaurantsAndShopping/Restaurants/The+Lido+Cafe/The+Lido+Cafe.htm) (which was also good).  On the way there, however, some idiot threw an almost-full can of Speights out of a fourth floor window and it hit me on the head (which was not good - but at least it was a glancing blow.  If it had hit me straight on I think it would have knocked me out).  

I wandered home after Lido, still slightly stunned, only to find when I got there that I'd lost all my keys somewhere along the way (definately very not good indeed).  So, wandered back in to town and met up with work folks for a beer before going to see some improvised comedy at the [Bats](http://www.bats.co.nz/) theatre (which was pretty good) and managed to completely forget about my loss of keys.  Couldn't get in touch with my flatmates, so ended up crashing at a friends place.  As well as all of this, due to overspending on my holiday the other week I've got very little cash and have more or less run out - a week before I get paid again!

Back on the plus side, my boss here has just told me how pleased he is with my work, and offered me a further short-term (6mth) contract back out here again (inc. flights!).  So, I could come home for a bit, catch up with folks, maybe work for a couple of months, and then come back out here and miss another pair of winters.  So, a rather eventful few days appears to have culminated in a very flattering and tempting offer. In short: _Blimey_.  I'll have to give this some serious thought, but the advantage is that I don't have to give an absolutely final answer until _after_ I've been home again.
