Well, I've got some accomodation booked for the first few nights.  I was worried for a second as Christchurch seems to be rather busy and I needed a bed for tonight, but it's all worked out okay and I'm crashing at a place called [Charlie B's](http://www.charliebs.co.nz/).  For Greymouth we have [Neptunes](http://www.bugpacific.com/reviews/New_Zealand/South_Island/Greymouth/nz286/) and for Franz Josef (where the main glaciers are) there is [Black Sheep Backpackers](http://www.franzjosef.co.nz/blkshp/black.html). All I have to do now is get enough work done to have 8 computers working for me while I'm away, fill out a leave form and chat to soem people here at work, meet up with the other Andy Jackson for a beer tonight, finish packing and make it to the airport in time for the 9:40pm flight.  Life is not dull at present. :)
