Well, after a slightly wobbly week (these malaria tabs are not without their wierd side effects), I'm looking forward to a fine weekend.  Sir Lord Richardo of Blythe is visiting, and some hanging about in [The Pleasance](http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edin/) and seeing of [random shows](http://edfringe.com) may occur.  Read on for my list of 'probably-sees'...
<!--break-->
This year, I will be mostly seeing...
* [The Cat Empire](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=CATEM) (cos they're the best live band I've ever seen)
* [The Stand Players: Completely Made Up](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=STANG) (cos my mate Paul's in it)
* [Free & Easy](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=FREEF) (cos my mate Paul's in it, and it's free - but mostly because it's free...)
* [In The Bath](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=INTHE) (cos my mate Tim InfiniteFitzHigham is in it - can you spot the trend?)
* [Simon Munnery's AGM](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=SIMOO) (cos he's a very strange man that makes me laugh)
* [Mark Thomas](http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&id=THOMA) (cos he's good)

There's about a million things on, so choosing what to see is always a bit arbitrary.  Tough life eh?

Oooh, and one more thing.  I've confirmed the dates for my time back in NZ, and once the papers are through I'll stick the dates on this site.  Oh, and apply for a work visa...  Minor detail. *cough*
