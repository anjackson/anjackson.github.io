Well, various problems for Air New Zealand have left me 4hrs late.   The connecting flights have been held, but I'm now leaving LAX at 6:40pm and getting into Heathrow at 1:05pm on Thursday.  My UK mobile is working, but I cannot phone or text out.  I guess I'll have to wait till London before I can phone anyone.  Better go get my compensatory free meal.  See you soon. Anj
