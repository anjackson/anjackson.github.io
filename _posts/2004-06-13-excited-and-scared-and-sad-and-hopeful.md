Well, crikey, my last night in Wellington.  Tomorrow morning I fly to Singapore for a few days, then most of a month in Thailand, Cambodia and, hopefully, Vietnam.  Rather mixed feelings at present, but I'm looking forward to being back home and catching up with everyone again.

I'll try to post stuff here as often as I can, just so you all know I'm still alive!  As long as the culture shock doesn't kill me, I'm sure I'll be just fine.  Even managed to pack as light (if not lighter) than I did on the way out, but it's going to be weird living out of a rucksack again.

See you on the other side of the world.
