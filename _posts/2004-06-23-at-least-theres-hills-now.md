Well, I've made it to Chang Mai, and found an okay place to stay.  The train ride was alright, but after having the same flat 'wet fields' view for the first 9 hours, I'm glad to be near some tall pieces of geography.  The place seems nice so far, but I've yet to explore very much.  The main thing I want to do is go up to a monastry on the mountainside of Doi Suthep, which will hopefully happen tomorrow.  

Time for breakfast.
