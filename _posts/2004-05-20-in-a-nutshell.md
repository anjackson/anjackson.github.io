Many years ago, I created an online database of links related to the [RISC OS](http://www.riscos.com/) platform called [Nutshells](http://anjackson.net/cgi-bin/nutshells.pl).  I thought it might be useful, but of course it quickly went out of date and I never had the time to update it.  Well, I may have found a solution.  I've just re-launched it [here](http://anjackson.net/cgi-bin/nutshells.pl), with essentially the same interface, except that it now allows all visitors to edit the site contents (rather like a [Wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki)).  Hopefully, this will allow the whole thing to be kept up to date with very little effort (at least on my part!).  I've submitted an article to [Drobe](http://www.drobe.co.uk/) about it, so I guess we'll just have to see what happens.
