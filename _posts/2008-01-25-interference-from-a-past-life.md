If you're having trouble sleeping, you could try downloading a highly exciting readable article called <a href="http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v76/e066703">Lattice-switch Monte Carlo for binary hard-sphere crystals</a>.  If you don't have access to that journal, you can <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0497">download the electronic pre-print here</a>. Although that kind of thing has rather little to do with the work I do now, it was good fun and it's nice to see the work getting published.
