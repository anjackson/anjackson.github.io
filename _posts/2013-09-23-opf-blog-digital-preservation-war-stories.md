<h1></h1>
<p>I've started to publish some of&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://anjackson.github.io/keeping-codes/">my notes on digital preservation</a>. It's mostly a collection of&nbsp;'war stories' and summaries of some of the little experiments I've carried out over the years, but never had time to write up properly. The idea of publishing these stories is inspired in part by <a class="external" href="http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2013-09-13-registries-we-need">XFNSTN</a>, but also by my experience co-coordinating the AQuA workshops and from observing the success of the SPRUCEdp project.</p>
<p>In short, I think we need to share more war stories, not just the occasional full research paper, but also the small stuff, and the failures. Maybe I can start the ball rolling by sharing mine. I'd really like to know if anyone else out there is interested in sharing theirs.</p>
<p>There's a couple of bigger items on there that I think might be of particular interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external" href="http://anjackson.github.io/keeping-codes/experiments/bbc-micro-data-recovery.html">A long-winded data migration story about accessing data from BBC Master floppy disks.</a></li>
<li><a class="external" href="http://anjackson.github.io/keeping-codes/experiments/Understanding%20Tools%20and%20Formats%20Via%20Bitwise%20Analysis.html">A description of how bitwise analysis can be used to better understand formats and the tools that act upon them</a>, somewhat related to an <a class="external" href="http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2013-02-14-exploring-impact-flipped-bits">OPF blog post by Jay Gattuso&nbsp;earlier this year</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback welcome, as ever.</p>
