Well, after a rather hectic few hours, I've made it to Greymouth.  The TranzAlpine crossing was fantastic - it really is as gorgeous as folks make out.  Even had an open viewing carridge, where I spent most of the time.  Yes - lots and lots of photos thanky you.  Franz Josef tomorrow - let's hope for groovy weather.
