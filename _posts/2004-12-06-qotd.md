This has to be the quote of the day, sent to me by Sarah who saw it in an Edinburgh newspaper over the weekend ([The Scotsman](http://www.scotsman.com/) I presume?).

:_"I was only given one piece of advice about women. 'A woman will forgive you if you try to kiss her, but she won't forgive you for not kissing her'."_ - Jimmy Carr.

Indeed.
<!--break-->
[Jimmy Carr](http://www.jimmycarr.com/) (who is a stand-up comedian by the way) is also responsible for another fine quote:
:_"It's easier to get forgiveness than permission."_
Unfortunately, this is only really funny in context, and that context is far from suitable for a family-friendly web log like this one.  Let your imagination roam wild and free.
