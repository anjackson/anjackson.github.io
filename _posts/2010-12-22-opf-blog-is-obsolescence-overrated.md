A new OPF blog entry: <a href="http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/node/590">Is obsolescence overrated?</a>. Reproduced below...

<p>I just wanted to point out a very interesting discussion on format obsolescence: <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2010/11/half-life-of-digital-formats.html">The Half-Life of Digital Formats</a>, <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2010/12/puzzling-post-from-rob-sharpe.html">A Puzzling Post From Rob Sharpe</a> and <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2010/12/rob-sharpes-case-for-format-migration.html">Rob Sharpe's Case For Format Migration</a>. I think this is a very important issue, and I think we must address it as it cuts to the core of what the Planets tools are for.&nbsp;</p><p>To summarise, David Rosenthal has asking for any good examples of widely-used file formats that were created later than 1995 and have since become obsolete. So far, no-one has been able to suggest a single 'obsolete' format that holds up to scrutiny. If you've got a good example of an obsolete format, please contribute to <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2010/11/half-life-of-digital-formats.html">that discussion</a>.</p><p>I started writing out my response to this issue, but it rapidly turned out to be too complex to cover in a single blog post. Overall, I agree that obsolecense should be treated as the exception rather than the norm, and indeed our preservation strategies at the British Library reflect that stance. However, I think there are some important cases where this approach may not be sufficient. Futhermore, even when obsolescence is an not an issue, there are still very many cases where I need better tools in order to manage our content, and think the OPF can help to ensure that suitable high-quality tools are available.</p><p>I'll come back to these two issues in some follow-up blogs, but for now, I'll wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>
