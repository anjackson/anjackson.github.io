I've now had a few days running about and catching up with family, touring around from London to Penzance, Sutton-in-Ashfield and Wirksworth (via Crich of course).  While visiting Denise, Martin, James & Adam in Penzance, they cooked my first roast beef dinner since I got back.  Oh how I've missed Yorkshire pudding!  It's been really good to see everyone again, but unfortunately I've not had quite as much time with folks as I'd like because I'm going back to Edinburgh on Sunday.  However, I did manage to make time to scan in the [information I got from Nestle](http://anjackson.net/node/view/735) which seems to settle [the Aero debate](http://anjackson.net/node/view/714).  May I draw your attention to the line _"The __traditional__ block Aero was redesigned to improve the breakage quality of the individual __chunks__."_ (emphasis mine).  I was, of course, right all along... ;)
