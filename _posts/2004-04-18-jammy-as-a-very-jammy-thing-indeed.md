[image:539,right,10,5]Crikey.  I am blessed.  Went onto the Franz Josef glacier today.  The west coast gets 5-8 metres of rain a year - so I was worried that the weather might be rough.  Actually ended up with perfect weather for the HeliHike.  It just _rocked_.  Fantastic helicopter flight, gorgeous blue ice and blue skies.  Really can't describe it adequately at all.  I've been so lucky with the weather on this trip - it can do what it likes now, as I've had more good fortune that I deserve.  Photos are great and more will be up soon.  

Off over the Haast pass in the Southern Alps tomorrow.  It's all good.
