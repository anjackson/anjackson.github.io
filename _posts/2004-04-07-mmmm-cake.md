Was looking for some cake recipes, as I am cooking cakes for friday-buns-on-thursday this week.
During the process I discovered [DeliaOnline|http://www.deliaonline.com/] and [The BBC Recipe Archive|http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/] which both seem to be excellent recipe sauces.

Unfortunately, I just remembered that my flat does not have a proper oven.  It's a blokes flat where everything is either fried, boiled or microwaved (but mostly fried).  Looks like I'll be buying a cake instead of making one, but at least I have a good excuse!
