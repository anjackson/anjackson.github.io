We're back in Renwick now, and today we will drive over to Picton, drop off the car and head back to Wellington.  We've done and seen a huge amount of things, taken a ridiculous number of photos, and had a lot of fun.  We've got a couple of days before we fly back to the UK, so hopefully we'll get some photos up on the web before too long : ) ...

a&e
