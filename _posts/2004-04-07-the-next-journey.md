Well, I'm off to Taupo with Stewart (my flatmate) and Kim (a visitor to the lab) this weekend.  Should be good.  It's Stewart's birthday on Sunday, and he's going to bungy-jump and then get very drunk.  My Dad suggested that this was the wrong way around.

And, I've just booked a flight to Christchurch and back, for a week of adventures on the south island.  I'll fly out on the 16th and return on the 26th, and see as much as humanly possible in the meantime.  Planning a HeliHike on a glacier - weather permitting of course.

After that, I'll have to sort out the return to the UK.  Blimey.
