Well, crikey, gave a first-year lecture today.  My boss couldn't be there, so he asked me to cover for him.  It was all a bit scary, and I fluffed it at the end, but I think it went reasonably okay.  It was good talk practice at any rate.  Bit of a mumbly bumbler though.

On a somewhat unrelated issue, I must say I'm really impressed with [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/).  Its a free online encyclopedia written by randoms, but quite a lot of it is rather good.  I've been looking at 
[A New Kind Of Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science_(book)),
[Langton's Ant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant),
[Algorithmic information theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory),
[Random number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number) and
[Bayesian Probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability).

Time for beer and quiz.
