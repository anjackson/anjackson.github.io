Well, I've finally confirmed my leaving date for the job here at Victoria University Wellington.  I'll be finishing work on the 11th of June, and probably heading out of the country a few days after.  Then I'm planning to spend about six weeks in south-east Asia, before heading back to the UK at the start of August.  In the meantime, my boss has kindly agreed to let me have a week off during April to go and explore the bits of the south island I've not seen yet.  Basically, it's all good.
