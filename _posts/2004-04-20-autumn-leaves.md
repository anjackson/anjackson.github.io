[image:541,right,10,10]Well, after being duly impressed by the Haast Pass, and staying in Makarora for a night (very nice - middle of nowhere type of thing), I've finally made it to Queenstown.  The Southern Alps really are remarkable, and the fact that all the views are decorated with the oranges, reds, coppers and golds of the autumn leaves just makes everything ridiculously pretty.

Unfortunately, I was feeling rather poorly yesterday - not sure why.  Anyways, this means I'm going to have a quiet one today and do the Milford Sound trip tomorrow.  There's plenty here in Queenstown, so I'll just potter about and see what happens.
