[right margin=5](image:1539) Here's a slide from the talk I gave to the group last Thursday.  It went well, and it was probably the most relaxed talk I've ever given.  I used to be horribly nervous about giving talks, so it's nice that (after lots of self-inflicted aversion therapy) I don't have a problem with giving them and indeed winging it.  I'll be giving some variation on the talk to [IRL](http://www.irl.cri.nz/) while I'm here, which will hopefully go just as well.
