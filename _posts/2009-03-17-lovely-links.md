Well, there's too many channels and too much noise.  

Should I [twitter](http://twitter.com/beardedstoat), or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), or [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/anj), or just collect [delicious links](http://delicious.com/beardedstoat)?  

But what on earth do I have time to say? Only a few things...

[Kutiman mixes YouTube](http://thru-you.com/#/videos/) - 100% YouTube clips, remixed.

[Röyksopp's Happy Up Here](http://www.offworld.com/2009/02/earth-invaders-royksopps-happy.html) - They are already here.

[Correlation](http://xkcd.com/552/) - I'm not sure.

[The Periodic Table of Typefaces](http://i.gizmodo.com/5169466/the-periodic-table-of-typefaces) - My inner-graphic-design-geek wants it.

Share & Enjoy
