[image](/node/[align=right](image:1593))Well, it's been a hectic couple of weeks, but the work has come along quite well.  We've even managed to finish the poster for the [AMN-2](http://www.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/AMN-2/) conference in [Queenstown](http://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/).  I've placed a copy of the poster here, so if you really are terribly bored (or are coming to the conference and want a geeky sneaky peek at the work, which is about as long a long shot as I can imagine) then you can click the on the thumbnail image thar....

The conference is my first proper physics one, so I hope there's some interesting stuff there.  And then after that, I'll be off to do the [Milford track](http://www.doc.govt.nz/Explore/002~Tracks-and-Walks/Great-Walks/Milford-Track/index.asp) with some folks from work and my good old Edinburgh chum [Suzanne](http://www.irc.leeds.ac.uk/~physf/) (not that old).  So hopefully, this blog might actually get more interesting over the next wee while.  You know, with pretty photos and suchlike.
