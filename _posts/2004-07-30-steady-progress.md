Well, work's going fairly well, and I'm still managing to enjoy being back!  It probably helps that the weather is pretty decent at the moment - it looks like being a good weekend.  Apart from work and the occasional beer, I've also been spending my evenings trying to sort my ~7000 Big Trip photos.  There are now a few new [Highlights](http://anjackson.net/image/tid/28) and [quite a lot more photos mostly unclassified as yet](http://anjackson.net/image/tid/29).

Also, saw Farenheit 9/11 last night with Jenny & Helle.  It's kinda full-on liberal propaganda, a shamelessly unbalanced bulldozer of a movie, unapologetically aiming to help eject GWB.  I have a lot of sympathy with [Michael Moore's](http://www.michaelmoore.com/) position (even if I don't necessarily agree with all his opinions/innuendo or his approach), but one can see how it would work well in America as a kind of Dr. Jekyll to Fox News' Mr Hyde, so I rather enjoyed it.  As J said, you can learn a lot about America not just from the subject - i.e. the material that is shown - but also about the intended audience from the way Moore chose to present the material to them.
