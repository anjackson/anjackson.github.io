Inspired by [Graham's efforts](http://www.grahamdavies.org/article.php?story=20040511145014366), I thought I'd tell you about some rather fine music I've discovered round these parts (click through for more information about the albums).  The New Zealand music scene is pretty varied and lively - it's not just Crowded House (thankfully!).  No idea how many NZ artists manage to get exported back home (not many, if any), but I suspect they've tried to send [Scribe](http://www.scribescribe.com/) over.  

I've been keeping track of the songs that have cropped up during my travels, and I'm planning to create a compilation album for them (like I did for the summer of 2002).  This will almost certainly include _The Boy With The Aubergine Hair'' from ''The 88'' and ''Nu Steppa'' from ''One Drop East_.
