The Prime Minister just appeared on television to apologise for the loss of the web log entries that should have been posted here.  The blogs were eventually found <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/7198043.stm">on a roundabout in Exeter</a>, but  have since been lost in the post while being posted back to the place they were originally posted from. 

So, to make up for the dearth of updates utterly failing to make an impression on this corner of the web, a new plan has been conjured up.  The administrative load of looking after this site was burning up all of the time that should have been spent writing stuff, so we've cut things right back and made them much simpler.  We've also resolved to try and post more frequent, if brief, entries, as we know quite a lot of our friends keep in touch with our movements through this site.  If you do, you might like to look at our new <a href="/news/">news page</a>.

ttfn,
a&e
