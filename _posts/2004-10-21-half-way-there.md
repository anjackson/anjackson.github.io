Made it to LA with a minimum of fuss.  It was actually a quite pleasant flight, with some fine views of Greenland and Canada.  Got a bit bored on towards the end, but flying into LA at night makes for a fairly spectacular finale.  The only minor problem was getting held up at immigration because I didn't have any kind of address for Catherine and Graham to put on my immigration card.  But then my fingerprints were scanned, my picture taken, the life of my first-born child signed over and they let me in.  The fools!
