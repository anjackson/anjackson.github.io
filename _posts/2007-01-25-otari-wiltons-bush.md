While staying in Ngaio, we visited [Otari-Wilton's Bush](http://www.otariwiltonsbush.org.nz/)...

> "Only 5 kilometres from downtown Wellington lies a unique treasure; 5 hectares of botanic gardens created for the collection and preservation of New Zealand's native plants nestled against the largest block of natural forest on the Wellington peninsula to survive initial settlement."

We've put our photos into [this fern-filled gallery](http://anjackson.net/ibgallery/150).
