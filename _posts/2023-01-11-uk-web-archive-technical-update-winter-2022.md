This is a summary of whatâ€™s been going on since [the update at the start of the autumn](https://blogs.bl.uk/webarchive/2022/10/uk-web-archive-technical-update-autumn-2022.html).

## 2022 Domain Crawl Completion

The 2022 Domain Crawl continued to run right up until the end of the year.


H3 space saving
2020 45TB for Heritrix State, and deleting old checkpoints did very little.

2021 15TB, and deleting old checkpoints has a more significant effect. Significantly cheaper.

W3ACT api-json-including-unpublished

Authenticated w3act users can now retrieve full collection extracts (including unpublished collections) from our static directory which is updated regularly:

Example:

https://www.webarchive.org.uk/act/static/api-json-including-unpublished/collection/4028.json

You need to be logged in as normal through w3act for authentication.

The public API access for unauthenticated extraction (i.e. excluding published collections) is undergoing integration and testing for deployment; we will notify you when it is available.
