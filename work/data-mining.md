To make sense of billions of documents, like those in the [UK Web Archive][1], we need to use data-mining techniques to make individual resources discoverable and understandable. My work has focussed on combining existing tools and developing new techniques to help understand large collections of diverse digital resources. This is necessary, not only to make the content discoverable and useful, got also to [care for and maintain access][2] to those collections.
