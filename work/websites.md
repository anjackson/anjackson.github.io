<h2>Portfolio</h2>
</a>

<h3>All by me...</h3>
<p align="justify">
Websites for which I am the sole author and maintainer.
</p>

<h4>anjackson.net</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://anjackson.net/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/aj-logo-sml.png" alt="aj logo" align="right"></a>
My personal web pages.  I manage to create a consisted look and maintain it easily by generating the pages from XML using XSLT.  The somewhat obscure navigation controls are perhaps the weakest aspect of the site, but you can get away with this kind of thing on a personal website.
</p>

<h4>nutshells</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://nutshells.anjackson.net/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/n-logo-sml.png" alt="nutshells logo" align="right"></a>
In online database of links for <a href="http://www.riscos.com/">RISC OS</a> users, written in Perl and using a custom flat-file database backend.  Quite old now, and perhaps a little basic, but still useful.
</p>

<h3>Partially mine...</h3>
<p align="justify">
Websites I have had a hand in developing and/or maintaining.
</p>

<h4>eChums.net</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://www.eChums.net/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/echums-logo-sml.png" alt="eChums logo" align="right"></a>
A new project, built mostly by myself but based on ideas generated by <a href="http://www.rab.org.uk">Richard Blythe</a>, <a href="http://www.grahamdavies.org">Graham Davies</a> and I.  Currently under development.
</p>


<h4>ILDG</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://www.lqcd.org/ildg/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/ildg-logo-sml.png" alt="ildg logo" align="right"></a>
Website for the international lattice datagrid community.
Essentially <a href="http://tikiwiki.sourceforge.net/">Tiki</a> - installed, tweaked and administrated by me.
</p>

<h4>HPCx</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://www.hpcx.ac.uk/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/hpcx-logo-sml.png" alt="hpcx logo" align="right"></a>
I created the Server-Side Include system that controls the overall look and feel of these pages, designed and implemented the CVS web-authoring mamagement procedure, and provided techinical help during the design and development of this site.  I was also one of a small
team of software engineers who created the <a href="https://www.hpcx.ac.uk/">HPCx Administration Server</a> - a complex system of Java Servlets, Java Server Pages and Perl Scripts.  For example, have a look at the <a href="http://www.hpcx.ac.uk/services/status/">service status page</a>. As well as designing the images and layout of this page,  I also wrote the backend which (for various reasons) passes the relevant data back along a code-invocation chain that runs SSI - Perl - Java Servlet - ssh login to service machine - Perl.
</p>

<h4>EPCC</h4>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/"><img src="/extras/images/logos/epcc-logo-sml.png" alt="epcc logo" align="right"></a>
I acted as a technical consultant during the procurement procedure for the EPCC website, and assisted their own web designer in the more technical aspects of the PHP-based system as the design was implemented and evolved.
