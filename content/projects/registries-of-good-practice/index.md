The ["Registries of Good Practice"](https://github.com/digipres/registries-of-practice-project#readme) project is a two-year (2024-2026) co-funded collaboration between the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) and Yale University Library (YUL). The project explored and developed different approaches to analyze, collate, present and, most importantly, make discoverable the many existing registries and collections of digital preservation good practice.
