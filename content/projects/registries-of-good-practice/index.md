The ["Registries of Good Practice"](https://github.com/digipres/registries-of-practice-project#readme) project is a two-year co-funded collaboration between the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) and Yale University Library (YUL). The project will explore and develop different approaches to analyze, collate, present and, most importantly, make discoverable the many existing registries and collections of digital preservation good practice.
