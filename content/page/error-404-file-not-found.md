!!! Error 404: File Not Found!
Just when things were going _so_ well...  Heigh ho.  
<!--break-->
<form action="old-site/public_html" method="POST">
The thing is, I'm in the process of reinvigorating my website, and many links will be broken in the meantime - sorry about that.  The current one starts at <http://anjackson.net/,> while the terminally curious can find my old web site <input type="submit" name="here" value="here"/>.</p>
</form>

You could always try a search via <http://anjackson.net/search/> - you never know, it might just work.
