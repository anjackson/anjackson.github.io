##  Accessibility
As of September 2002, the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) made it unlawful for any higher-education establishment to place a disabled student at any kind of 'significant disadvantage'.  As EPCC now offers courses to students, this legislation affects us.  Here are a few links on the subject.
* __Edinburgh__
    * A good overview, _if you read nothing else, read this_: [Web Help at the Univeristy of Edinburgh - Accessibility](http://webhelp.ucs.ed.ac.uk/docs/accessibility.html).
    * [Disability Policy](http://www.disability-office.ed.ac.uk/disability_policy99.htm) (under review due to SENDA).
* __National__
    * This site has pointers to all the legal documents and some good articles: [UK Resources for Web Accessibility and the Law](http://www.web-accessibility.org.uk/)
* __Making Pages Accessible__
    * The Web Accessibility Initiative: [w3c WAI](http://www.w3.org/WAI/)
    * The Bobby WAI online webpage testing tool: [Bobby](http://bobby.watchfire.com/)
    * Examples of what can be achieved using only CSS for your design, with pure content in the HTML: [The CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) and [CSS Beauty](http://www.cssbeauty.com/).  Note that this approach ensures the _content_ is visible on any browser, but the _design_ may degrade unpredictably on those awkward 'middle-aged' browsers (Netscape 4.x, IE 4.x).
