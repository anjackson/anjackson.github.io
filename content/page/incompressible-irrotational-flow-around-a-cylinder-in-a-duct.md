### Incompressible Irrotational Flow around a Cylinder in a Duct
## An application of finite element methods
This experiment concerned the accurate simulation,
via the finite element method, of the behaviour of an
incompressible irrotational fluid flow around a cylinder
in a duct. Our aims were to find the conditions under
which the grid performs reasonably well and then to
examine how the width of the duct affects the flow (in
comparison to the analytical solution for an isolated
cylinder). It was discovered that while a reasonable
mesh can be easily defined, a really accurate mesh is
difficult to predict. Also, the simulation was found to
fail for high and low duct widths, and ways to improve
the overall performance of the simulation are
discussed.
