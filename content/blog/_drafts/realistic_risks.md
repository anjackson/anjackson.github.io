Tellingly, even the Guardian can't seem to remember that it's sold this story before:

> The Digital Dark Age ... Still Looming After All These Years: [2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20030110082553/http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,871091,00.html) to [2015](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/google-boss-warns-forgotten-century-email-photos-vint-cerf)

With our minuscule budgets (compared to Google), with austerity cutting ever deeper, and with an persistent pressure to outsource everything, it's the libraries and governments of the world that are expected to solve this problem.

Apart from that, well, at least I hope that Google's decision to highlight this issue means that we have the right to highlight when Google makes decisions that make preserving digital resources more difficult.


Certainly those organisations have the remit, but do they have the capability?

Tension in market

The question is, then, how do we turn this big news story into concrete action?


- c.f. also that IDCC15 blockchain talk. http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc15/programme-presentations 
- ‘A system for distributed minting and management of persistent identifiers’ Lukasz Bolikowski et al.

- Help us cope with [DRM in HTML5](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2614597/cringely/drm-sinks-its-fangs-into-html5--with-help-from-netflix--google--and-microsoft.html)
- Provide access to [DRM eBooks](https://support.google.com/books/partner/answer/3309439?hl=en-GB) (hey, at least [you're using ePub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Books#File_formats)!)
- Provide Olive-style enviroments for Android and apps.


* Keep args about timescale switching etc. and technical issues etc. elsewhere.
* Your shoebox of photos won't last 1000 years either.
* Migration of signals (all these VM things) still have issues. Essentially a 'preservation platform', but has to subsume compexity of all the other platforms. Can you run Windows 8 on a 386? Will Windows 3.11 run on 64bit hardware. The edges are very complex, and the whole thing probably has the combinatorical problem.
    * i.e. unique differentiable combinations of application software. (Order of installation!)
    * i.e. unique differentiable combinations of hardware.
    * You can sell it to me as 'covering a lot of ground', but you can't sell it as 'perfect'.
