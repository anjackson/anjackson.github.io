After a small delay, we were finally able to formally launch the _Registries of Good Practice_ project! You can find the formal announcement here: [Registries of Good Practice: New project launched to help practitioners discover digital preservation resources](https://www.dpconline.org/news/registries-of-good-practice)

We'll be following up shortly to try and clarify some of the aims of the project, and how the proposed Preservation Registries Special Interest Group (PR-SIG) might work. But I just wanted to say a quick word about how I'm approaching this.

I've become a bit of a fan of [Wardley mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/introduction/) in recent years. I'm not saying it's perfect, but I think a lot of the ideas in it are genuinely useful. The model of how technologies evolve is well-grounded and helpful. The notion of being driven by user needs and understanding the technological dependencies beneath them is valuable.

I'm not sure where the project will end up, but we can start by clarifying the [purpose](https://learnwardleymapping.com/purpose/) of the project, in the form of some initial goals.  With that in mind, we can start to outline some of the principles (or ["doctrine"](https://learnwardleymapping.com/doctrine/)) that will guide our work.

Hopefully, that should help get things going, and start to articulate the value of joining in.

Watch this space...
