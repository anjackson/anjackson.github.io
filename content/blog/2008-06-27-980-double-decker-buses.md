For those of you who have trouble imaging how long 980 double decker buses would be, try imagining 1/38440th of the distance between the Earth and the Moon.  Alternatively, it's ~10km. By pure coincidence, this just happens to be the distance that Eilidh ran last Sunday ([Photo finish here](http://www2.global-pix.com/cgi-bin/masterpage?function=photo;section=photos;job=Sports%2FCPUK%2F2008%20Sports%2FLeeds%2010K;lang=eng;match=5463;identlist=TOMR2706,TOMR2707,TOMX0539;identindex=3)) raising money for [Yorkshire Cancer Centre](http://www.yorkshirecancercentre.org.uk/).
