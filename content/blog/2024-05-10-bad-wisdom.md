I'm not sure publishing [For The Love](/2024/05/07/for-the-love/) was really a good idea. There's been enough positive feedback that I'm going to leave it up, but I suspect it split the room. If I'm going to write things like that, I have to be willing to put with the fact that some people might think it's pure cringe. 

As I'm clearly a poor judge of when that approach is acceptable, there's a risk that I'm encouraging people to do something that may backfire badly. 

Perhaps there's mode to aim for that's somewhere closer to [this lighter tone](/2024/05/09/rummaging-in-the-ipres-pantry-with-rclone/). That might be wiser, for now at least.
