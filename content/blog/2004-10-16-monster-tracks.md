{% include _image.html nid="1434" align="right" hspace="" vspace="" width="" %}__Monster__ track has to be _Wow_ from _Final Straw_ by _[Snow Patrol](http://www.snowpatrol.net/)_.  It really rather hits the mark.  In fact the [whole album](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001BH15K/202-6537669-9498213) is pretty darned good.  Go get it.  _Spitting Games_ is also a favourite, if only for the lines:
:_My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes_
:_As blue as oceans and as pure as skies_
And _Grazed Knees_ is a bit of a stand-out track too.

Other top tunes I've discovered up while being back include _[Franz Ferdinand](http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk/)_, _[Maroon 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/music/muze/index.pl?site=music&action=list_album&album_id=714402)_, _[zero 7](http://www.zero7.co.uk/)'_s new album _[When It Falls](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/music/muze/index.pl?site=music&action=list_album&album_id=157872)_, _Grit_ by _[Martyn Bennet](http://realworldrecords.com/grit/)_, _[Jet](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/music/muze/index.pl?site=music&action=list_album&album_id=718483)_, _[The Thrills](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/profiles/thrills.shtml)_ and _[Kasabian](http://www.kasabian.co.uk/)_.

Was also surprised to find out that these UK folks hadn't heard of [Steriogram](http://www.steriogram.com/) yet.  I hadn't realised that they were an NZ band, and the near-saturation play of the award winning knitted video for the fine single _Walkie Talkie Man_ in NZ and the fact that that same track was being used in the UK iPod advertisements had lulled me into a false sense of, erm, understanding what what going on.  Or something.  Go [check 'em out](http://www.steriogram.com/).

Not long now.  And still not packed.  Don't. Panic.
