As you might have noticed, I'm in the process of re-jigging this website.  The new look has been chosen largely just to keep things simple, as I don't really have the time to maintain my own modules and theme code any more! So, expect a new, improved, yet stripped-down service from now on!
<!--break-->
Short-form updates will now be done largely on Twitter (see block at the right), and longer-form updates and content will be posted here. Unfortunately, due to the constant attempts of spammers to create accounts on this site, I'm not allowing sign-ups and so the commenting functionality is rendered rather pointless. I'm looking for a solution, but I've not found a good one yet.
