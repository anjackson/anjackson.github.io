Inspired by the excellent <a href="http://twitter.com/dhnow">@dhnow</a> <a href="http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/about/">social news service</a>, I've set up a news aggregator for digital preservation. The <a href="http://twitter.com/digipresnews">@digipresnews</a> account follows people involved in digital preservation, and I use the <a href="http://twittertim.es/digipresnews">Twitter Tim.es</a> service to extract the top links of interest. This also provides an RSS feed, which is piped back into the Twitter account via <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">twitterfeed</a>.

Of course, this type of aggregation is only as good as its sources, so if I've missed a digital preservation tweeter, or included someone you think I shouldn't have done, contact me <a href="http://twitter.com/lovelycode">@here</a> or <a href="/contact">here</a>.
