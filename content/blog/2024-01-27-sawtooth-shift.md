On Monday and Tuesday, I was still working at the British Library. But on Wednesday morning, I started my new role at the Digital Preservation Coalition. I'm not sure why I thought this gapless leap was a good idea, but despite the sudden shift, I've had a great week and I'm really looking forward to getting this new project rolling.

There's lots to do and lots of good ideas roiling around, so we're working on putting together an official announcement post that should help set the stage. Keep an eye on the [DPC website](https://www.dpconline.org/news) for updates!
