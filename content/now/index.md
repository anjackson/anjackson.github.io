This is my [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

As of October 2024, I am...

* ...the Preservation Registries Technical Architect at the [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/).
* ...nine months into a two-year project called ["Building registries of digital preservation good practice"](https://github.com/digipres/registries-of-practice-project).
* ...spending some of my time maintaining our shared digital preservation resources, like the [digipres.org community portal](https://digipres.org/) and the community-managed [Awesome List for digital preservation](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

Outside of work, I am...

* ...wittering on [Mastodon, thanks to digipres.club](https://digipres.club/@anj).
* ...listening to music a lot. Mostly *Billie Eilish* and *Florence + The Machine* it seems.
* ...listening to podcasts a bit. Usually some subset of [Kermode & Mayo's Take](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/kermode-mayos-take/id1616559297), [The Adam Buxton Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-adam-buxton-podcast/id1040481893), [RHLSP](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/rhlstp-with-richard-herring/id520831548), [Off Menu](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/off-menu-with-ed-gamble-and-james-acaster/id1442950743), [The Bugle](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bugle/id265799883), [The Gargle](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gargle/id1552687312), [Three Bean Salad](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/three-bean-salad/id1564066507), [NonCensored](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/noncensored/id1627769057) and [The Comedian's Comedian Podcast (a.k.a. ComComPod)](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-comedians-comedian-podcast/id513734888).
* ...listening to audiobooks occasionally. Most recently [Kill It with Fire -- Manage Aging Computer Systems (and Future Proof Modern Ones) by Marianne Bellotti](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Kill-It-with-Fire-Audiobook/0593501721).
* ...hoping to get time to play with my [Cosmic Unicorn](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/space-unicorns?variant=40842626596947).
* ...being beaten at any and all videogames by my son.
