This is my [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

As of January 2024, I am...

- ...the Preservation Registries Technical Architect at the [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/).
- ...working on a two-year project called ["Building registries of digital preservation good practice"](https://github.com/digipres/registries-of-practice-project).
- ...spending some of my time maintaining our shared digital preservation resources, like the [digipres.org community portal](https://digipres.org/) and the community-managed [Awesome List for digital preservation](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

Outside of work, I am...

- ...wittering on [Mastodon, thanks to digipres.club](https://digipres.club/@anj).
- ...listening to podcasts, like [The News Agents](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-news-agents/id1640878689), [Full Disclosure](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/full-disclosure-with-james-obrien/id1454408831), [Pod Save The UK](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/pod-save-the-uk/id1683411536), [Reasons To Be Cheerful](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/reasons-to-be-cheerful-with-ed-miliband-geoff-lloyd/id1287081706), [Kermode & Mayo's Take](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/kermode-mayos-take/id1616559297), [The Adam Buxton Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-adam-buxton-podcast/id1040481893), [RHLSP](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/rhlstp-with-richard-herring/id520831548), [Off Menu](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/off-menu-with-ed-gamble-and-james-acaster/id1442950743), [The Bugle](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bugle/id265799883), [The Gargle](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gargle/id1552687312), [Three Bean Salad](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/three-bean-salad/id1564066507), [NonCensored](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/noncensored/id1627769057) and [The Comedian's Comedian Podcast (a.k.a.
