This is my [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

As of January 2026, I am...

* ...a Digital Preservation Specialist at the [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/).
* ...finishing up some loose ends from a two-year project called ["Building registries of digital preservation good practice"](/projects/registries-of-good-practice/).
* ...spending some of my time maintaining our shared digital preservation resources (especially the ones mentioned on the [digipres.org community portal](https://digipres.org/)[](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)) and [trying to support others who want to help out](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/pr-sig).
* ...wittering on [Mastodon, thanks to digipres.club](<>).
