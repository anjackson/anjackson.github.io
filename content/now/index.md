This is my [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

As of December 2023, I am...

- ...the Web Archiving Technical Lead at the British Library. I'm responsible for the technical aspects of the ingest, indexing, discovery and access to the [UK Web Archive](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/).
- ...until the 24th of January 2024, when I start a new role as the Preservation Registries Technical Architect at the Digital Preservation Coalition.  I'm joining them to work on a two-year project called "Building registries of digital preservation good practice".
- ...so I'm trying to hand everything over to the UKWA team....
- ...while also dealing with some of the consequence of [a serious cyber attack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67544504).

Outside of work, I am...

- ...hoping to get time to play with my [Cosmic Unicorn](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/space-unicorns?variant=40842626596947).
- ...being beaten in videogames by my son.
