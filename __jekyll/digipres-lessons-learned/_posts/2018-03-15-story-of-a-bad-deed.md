I love a digital preservation mystery, and this one started with question from [@joe](https://digipres.club/@joe/) on [digipres.club](https://digipres.club/):

<iframe src="https://digipres.club/@joe/99650486509645352/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400"></iframe><script src="https://digipres.club/embed.js" async="async"></script>

A mystery file, starting with `0x0baddeed`, eh? Fascinating. Those hex digits didn't happen be accident. Using four-digit hex patterns to signal format is an extremely common design pattern, but no authority hands them out -- each format designer mints them independently. There must be a story here...

The first step is to find other examples to work with. For exactly this reason, I deliberately built a special feature into our search indexes: the ability to seach for files based on the first four bytes. Gratifyingly, [someone else](https://digipres.club/@nkrabben) beat me to it:

<iframe src="https://digipres.club/@nkrabben/99650687654066239/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400"></iframe><script src="https://digipres.club/embed.js" async="async"></script>

Poking around in [the underlying data](https://gist.github.com/anjackson/1cb69ae72eadea65a50e348b71d93d2d) it was clear that the [179 files that matched this query](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/search?query=content_ffb:%220baddeed%22) all appeared to be PowerPoint files based on the file extension, but neither [DROID](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/policy-process/digital-continuity/file-profiling-tool-droid/) nor [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) could say any more.

A [search of PRONOM](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Format/proFormatSearch.aspx?status=new) showed two separate records for [Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh 4.0](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Format/proFormatSearch.aspx?status=detailReport&id=885) and [Microsoft Powerpoint Presentation 4.0](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Format/proFormatSearch.aspx?status=detailReport&id=133), but no earlier versions. In this case, [Wikipedia faired better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint), [linking to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint#cite_note-early-file-compatibility-252) this [nice overview of the format compatability between PowerPoint versions](https://web.archive.org/web/20130510103008/http://www.bitbetter.com/powerfaq.htm#versions).

While the [File Format Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/PPT) did not have much detail for the early versions of PowerPoint, it did [link](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/PPT#Sample_files) to [a source of sample files](https://web.archive.org/web/20020313074855/http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/Internet-documents/isoc/charts/presentations/)[^2]. This proved to be very fortunate indeed...

I downloaded some of the old sample files from there, and compared them against the `0x0baddeed` files. Here's the start of one of the sample file:


```

and here's the start of one of the `0x0baddeed` files...

```

Do you see it? Look closer...

```
$ hexdump -C BidStrat.ppt | head -1

Both the first and second four bytes match, but are reversed! Welcome to the confusing world of [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) (see also [Apple's docs on byte ordering](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/ByteOrdering.html))[^1].

Most computers use a byte-ordering called 'little-endian', but the older Mac used an alternative ordering called 'big-endian'. This is just two different conventions for storing data, and I can't look at `0x0baddeed` and know which ordering it is. However, the discovery of `ppt` files starting with either `0x0baddeed` or `0xeddead0b` is consistent with the same type of data being stored in different endian-orders.

Indeed, [searching for the reversed pattern finds 430 files](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/search?query=content_ffb:%22eddead0b%22), and better still the [online version of TRiD](http://mark0.net/onlinetrid.aspx) determines these to be early PowerPoint files.

![TRiD Result]({{site.url}}/digipres-lessons-learned/images/trid-result-for-nii-ppt.png)

In fact, [it looks like TRiD is also able to distinguish between versions 2.0 and 3.0](http://file-extension.net/seeker/file_extension_ppt), but only for the more common byte-ordering.

Sadly, there is no trivial 'fix' for this. You can't just go through the whole file and flip the bytes, because only some chunks are stored like that. If you use the `strings` command to extract the text, it's in the expected order, not half-flipped, because it's stored as a byte stream not [32-bit 'words'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)). The only way to open these files will be to use PowerPoint 2.0 or 3.0 in an emulator, and although either should be able to open both, they are effectively distinct formats. I'm not able to test this, but maybe someone else can?

But why `0x0baddeed`? Well, I started to speculate that this was a statement from a disgruntled developer. PowerPoint 2.0 was the first version of PowerPoint that ran on both Macs and PCs, and a joke that only reveals itself on one platform would be just the kind of thing I'd expect from a community that relishes Rick-rolls. But then after I thought I had this idea, I realised it feels more like a memory. Can any one else remember a story like this? Please let me know!

[^1]: I remain frustrated that I still find endianness confusing. In the past, I managed to cobble together a port of a [little-endian platform emulation](https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/) that ran on my big-endian Mac, and despite the fact I got it working I never felt like I really understood it properly!
