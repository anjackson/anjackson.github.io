I just asked my MP (Alec Shelbourne) to vote against the DRIP bill, which attempts to enshrine overreaching surveillance as national legislation, despite the fact that it clearly contradicts human rights legislation.

I wrote, because I feel I must, but I believe it to be futile.

My hope in politics is broken.

Looking back, it seems it was the Iraq war that broke me. I am generally optimistic and hopeful. The obsessive circling of politics and the mainstream media ground me down, but after [those protests][1], what was left to try. At least three-quarters of a million people marched on London to Stop The War, and many millions more abroad. Calmly, peacefully, and clearly, we marched.

I remember watching the live television feeds on 9/11. I remember the fear and horror. 

And the finger pointed to Afghanistan, and although I'm now more queasy about how easily I accepted this at the time, we were with our governments then. Afghanistan was widely understood to be under a dangerous and repressive regime, and to have played a very direct and active role in international terrorism. So our armies went in, to protect ourselves and to remove that regime.

And the Iraq came up. It never made any sense. Clearly Saddam was a terrible dictator, but there are many still, as bad or worse, that we leave well alone or even cooperate with. The story of Iraq's position as a international terrorist thread was never even close to being convincing. Even the dodgiest dossier was not enough. It made no sense at all. The true reasons for the war were unclear, and remain unclear to this day.

So we marched.

And then nothing. As I remember it, not even any acknowledgement of our position at all. Just shallow rhetoric and on we go to war. Much smaller marches have had much greater effects (citation needed etc!).

And since then, of course, we were proven right. The war was a based on bad data, and the dilution of effort ensured the Afghanistan mission also failed. Many, many innocent civilians have died.

Have those involved apologies? Have they been held accountable? No.

The only real consequence seems to be that civilised protest is being [slowly squashed out of existence][2]. The problem was not the war. The problem was that we marched.
