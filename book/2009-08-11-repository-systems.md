## Digital Object Storage Systems

- The file system.
  - Actually, many different implementations and not enough standards.
- Content Management Systems
  - [Fedora](http://www.fedora-commons.org/documentation/3.0b1/userdocs/digitalobjects/objectModel.html)
  - [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/)
  - [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/) (embedded by Adobe)
  - Anything with an OAI-PMH interface (see next section).
- Similar to [Open Service Interface Definitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Service_Interface_Definitions)?
