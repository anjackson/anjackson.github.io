The other sections of this notebook generally assume that there will be some digital objects storage system that can be relied upon to hold the bytes safely over time. Indeed, I believe it is sensible to deal with the bit-storage and access problems separately, in the sense that any access solutions should be designed to work independently of the chosen bit-store solution. 

I used to think that the bit-storage problem was [essentially solved](/2008/06/27/science_digital_preservation), but I have since realised that fighting bit-rot is not as easy as I originally thought.
