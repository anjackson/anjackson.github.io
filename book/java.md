## Project Notes

### Text Editors
[Opinion](http://ronperrella.com/)
"I think there are key features that powerful text editors share and a few that should be but are not as common. 
* Macro languages in which to program extensions 
* Command lines in which to type commands too complex for keystrokes 
* Ability to bind commands to keys and key sequences/chords 
* Ability to "fold" documents (i.e. hide uninteresting parts) 
* Syntax color highlighting (big help for debugging) 
* Syntax sensitivity (to be able to suggest proper statement completion) 
* Abbreviation 
* Compile buffer, so I can compile and fix bugs as they appear. 
* Directory listing and file management 
* FTP/SSH/"Virtual File Systems", allowing access to remote systems. "
