Here, we will not worry about the system that [keeps the bits safe](/digital_preservation_notebook/bit_preservation), but start with the assumption that we have some reliable digital object repository that supports one or more protocols, allowing items to be read and written.
 
 * [BuildingScalableInfrastructures]

Ideally, we want repositories of digital objects, with features like:

 * Versioning.
 * Change-logs/audit trails.
 * Metadata attachments
 * Relationships.
 * Trusted Repository ([TRAC](http://www.crl.edu/content.asp?l1=13&l2=58&l3=162&l4=91)) conformance.
