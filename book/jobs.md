### Jobs
Career-related stuff for geeks like me.
<!--break-->

## Websites
There are many recruitment websites, but it is rather difficult to know which ones are actually well-used and popular with employers.  Monster may have much advertising, and I started there assuming that this meant it was a good site to use.  It's not, and in retrospect perhaps the reason there was so much advertising for it was precisely because few people use it.

Anyways, I found that [JobSite](http://www.jobsite.co.uk/) is pretty good for IT, but is perhaps superceded by the most highly recommended site I've found so far, [Planet Recruit](http://www.planetrecruit.com/).  Apparently this includes most if not all of the JobSite positions, with quite a few more on top.

## Working in IT
* [How To Be A Programmer](http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/) by Robert L. Read - An interesting set of tips and other things the author wishes they had known before starting out on a career in programming.
* A pretty good thing along similar lines: [techjob part 1](http://homepage.mac.com/monickels/techjob.html), [techjob part 2](http://homepage.mac.com/monickels/techjob2.html).
* [The Career Programmer: Guerilla Tactics For An Imperfect World](http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/list_articles.asp?userid=29452) hosted @ [codeproject](http://www.codeproject.com/).
