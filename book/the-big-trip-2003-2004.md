<a href="/book/view/1301"><img src="/images/thumbs/thumb_worldmap_s-1300.png" alt="World Map" border="0" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px"/></a>Towards the end of 2003, I decided to throw caution to the wind, travel the world, and aim for a new record in personal debt.  It was a very successful year.  Caution was thrown, the world was traveled, and my bank manager now sobs with laughter whenever I phone to ask for more money.  But he's crying on the inside.  I can tell.
