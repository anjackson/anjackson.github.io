title: The Registry We Need
---

## A Registry Plan
- DPTR take the good bits.
- Aggregate sources, but start with as simple model as possible.
- Use it to bring sources together, compare them, look for inconsistencies.
- Fix the sources rather than edit.
- Software side, create test files in various version of software. etc. (NLA-style).
- Have recurring workshops at iPres and IIPC GA where those who are interested get together and add more information to an existing registry.
