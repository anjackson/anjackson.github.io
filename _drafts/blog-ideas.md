Quelle Surprise, Quelled Surprise
- You may not be surprised simply because you've already considered it. Would you have also said the same if the exact opposite had been found. There must be a name for this kind of bias. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias
- You may not be surprised because this does simply confirm a widely-held belief. Congratuations, you have elevated a hunch to something approximating objective truth!
- Picking out individual stories are representative required evidence that they are representative. (this buts both ways, distant-to-close too)

That's kind of the point. Outsourcing the tech further disempowers the 'web archiving gang'. If organisations…
only invest in hand-wringers, that's all they'll be able to do. The situation is bad enough already, as you say.
No-one is blaming IA for this & of course channeling funds to support IA is far better than doing nothing at all.

UKWA we do capture contemporary renderings during the crawl, and other contextual data. The hope is that…
…this will help those who *do* take on sw/access preservation to be confident they are doing it right…
… But I'm not sure it'll be us that's 
My point being it depends on the shape ones collection. A web archive is mostly full of content intended to…be shared across platforms.

Although there would be some minor duplication between the two, the volume of data involved would be tiny. Anyway, having two independent but overlapping collections helps build trust in both, because you can compare them to see if they are consistent (and therefore more likely to be complete, accurate, etc.).

## Fragments

### 2012, the year DP jumped the shark

- Rothenberg arguing dp should outline its society by design - long now
- Rosenthal's straw man
- HTML as rothenbergs types
- Still apparently arguing Migration v Emulation, more straw men
- Unproven strategies taught?
- Hopelessly overambitious levels of preservation, most folks need reasons to get off the bottom rung.

### The Fourth Age Of Cataloguing ###

0. Books on shelves. locations in head.
1. Card catalogue of physical items
2. Online card catalogue OPAC of physical items
3. Online catalogue of digitised physical items
4. Online catalogue of born digital material.

We have been here before... [Google Directory No Longer](http://www.seroundtable.com/google-directory-gone-13731.html)

### On Format Languages ###
http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Format/proFormatSearch.aspx?status=detailReport&id=1160&strPageToDisplay=summary
I understand the desire to focus PRONOM development on creating signatures, and I realise that keeping the references up to date would be a lot of work. However, I worry that signatures alone are not enough, because without the references, I don't think it's clear what is actually being identified. Without reference to any version of the ISO spec., or indeed MS Office, what does it mean to identify a file as 'Open Office XML' fmt/412? That kind of fine-grained identification is critically important if you wish to really understand the preservation issues around OOXML, because on the strict form has transparent semantics and can be considered preservation friendly. The transitional form is full of opaque semantics like 'render this paragraph like Word95 does'.

Except, actually, right now, it doesn't matter, because as far as I know there is no generally available software that implements OOXML Strict (I think only the latest Office betas do so). So right now, the ambiguity in the PRONOM definition is harmless, and getting into the details is pretty much a waste of time. If you just need to ID files right now, it works just fine.

http://www.zdnet.com/office-to-finally-fully-support-odf-open-xml-and-pdf-formats-7000002696/

Except, except, when the new versions arrive, and the various formats start to get supported to varying degrees, and the standard keep moving and 

Also, it's worth noting that the Open Digital Formats Registry idea is quite close to the Registry Ecosystem idea outline here (http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2011-02-15-file-format-registry-report-released). I used to be quite skeptical about this idea, but I've come around to it (http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-07-06-biodiversity-and-registry-ecosystem).


### Standards For Fragments

Issue about CITE paper, W3C Fragment effort, and issue about whether the fragment can reference the entity rather than the resource.

<http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue67/blackwell-hackneyBlackwell/> <http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/>

In particular, if we wish the fragment identifiers to be insulated from some details., i.e. fractions used be CITE rather than pixels, we need to get that in the standard? It does % for spatial dimensions, so is that okay? is that precise enough? What if we want to point at something really small? How many SigFig.


### Cargo Cult Standards

p.s. and if I anyone starts writing yet another standalone identifier, provenance or metadata standard from scratch, I will come around to your house, take away your computer, and replace it with a Chrome tablet so you always have to GOOGLE IT FIRST. :-)

Every time you start writing a new standalone metadata standard from scratch, God kills a kitten. Please make it stop.


### Letters to my son

- Plans for digital preservation
- Scaleability from the low side, to contrast with BL scale later.
- A business opportunity?
- Costs manageable via scale?


### Coding at Scale

Scaling Issues: File numbers

* DROID file handles
* Results, all in memory, JHOVE v Tika.
* Also, Tika at scale issue, where keeping the same class was building up RAM? Need to reinstanciate to make things stop going OOM and/or running OOFileHandles. (???)

Scaling issues: File size, 
Aggressive random-access-file opening:
https://github.com/openplanets/droid/commit/2c9f9b1a86e3fd219ecc8b8ed4cde0b81cfe2057

If you want to really optimise this thing, it should be possible to do all this (including checksum calculation) while only streaming over the whole input stream once. I've been trying to do that in our web archive indexer (which also incorporates the Nanite tool) with some success, but gracefully handling large files is not proving easy when some tools (e.g. DROID, PDFBox Preflight) tend to assume that you have a random access file and can flip to the end of the bitstream and back easily.
