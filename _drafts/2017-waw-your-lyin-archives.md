Original title: Catching up with current events â€“ the challenges for capture and access to web archives

Can an archive lie to you

It can mislead

Published date versus crawl date.

Bias by ommission. Either technical, or more subtly, by unintended curatorial bias. 

But can it just lie? 

Mistakes, and hacks.

When building large, distributed computer systems, you have to engineer for failure.

When we build large, long-lived information systems, we have to take the same approach. It's not just about preventing ourselves from being hacked. If that's out only answer we've just given ourselves yet another single point of failure. We have to work out how to ensure the historical record is accurate, even if our instution is hacked. 

As our digital libraries and archives become more and more important as historical record, we're going to have to find ways to work together to support eachother in this.
