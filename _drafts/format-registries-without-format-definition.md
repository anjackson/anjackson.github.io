Not necessarily. Zoological classification proceeded apace without consensus on terms like Species, long before we understood DNA and the Periodic Table started to take shape before we could tell all the atoms from all the molecules. BUT the price you pay is that you must accept that your taxonomy may have to change as our understanding grows. Species are renamed, Nobel gases discovered

not necessarily, but I don't  think you can expect the entries and IDs to be permanent when the semantics are subjective.

'Today' can refer to, but is not part of, the Gregorian Calendar.

Imagine if we archived the web, and all the timestamps just said 'Today'! Calendars make dates preservable.


Let's say someone edits the text of a PRONOM entry. Does it still mean the same? How do we know?
