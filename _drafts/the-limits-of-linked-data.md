## What Linked Data Can't Solve
- Worked examples of conflict resolution.
- Trust & Provenance

Schema.org and Facebook's Open Graph Protocol are also big users of linked data vocabularies and web linking schemes.

The Brits are the lead, a number of their open sites, based on the Ordnance Survey maps among others, use linked data. Within the US, we have demonstrated a lot of uses at hackathons, in some of the competition winning apps, and in some the info sources available on line.
